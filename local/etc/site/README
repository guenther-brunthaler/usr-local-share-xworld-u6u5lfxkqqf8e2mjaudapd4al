Site-specific customizations of shell .profile

The directory containing this README file should have been
symlinked as /usr/local/etc/site.

In order to enable the framework for including site-specific as
well as per-user custom settings in your ~/.profile, source (not
execute!) the shell snippet /usr/local/etc/site/site-goodies from
there.

This script will basically source shell snippets snippets from
different locations in the right order, saving you the trouble to
do it yourself.

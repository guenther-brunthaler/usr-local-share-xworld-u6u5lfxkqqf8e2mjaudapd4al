Classified Hierarchy - Directory Information
============================================

The contents of this directory and all of its subdirectories are stored on
securely encrypted disk partitions.

It replicates the directory hierarchy of the / directory in a safe place.

Users or groups which need to store classified or otherwise security-relevant
data should have an administrator create a subdirectory here for them.

Data stored within those directories will then be permanently encrypted and
will only be decrypted transparently on-the-fly as the data is accessed by
application.

In other words, it will look and feel like normal directories to the user, but
actually it's all strongly encrypted.

When the system is shut down (such as a consequence of being getting stolen),
the in-RAM-only decryption password will be lost.

And when the system is rebooted later, the decryption password will not be
known by the thief, and thus he cannot decipher the encrypted data.

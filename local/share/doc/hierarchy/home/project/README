project - Directory Information
===============================

Subdirectories of this directory will be created by administrators upon user
request for specific projects which are neither inherently user- nor
group-specific.

That is, those directories will relate to specific projects rather than being
grouped according to permissions, membership or general topic.

For instance, it is OK to create

/home/project/our_openoffice_fork

but clearly group-specific things should better go to

/home/group/games/tips_and_tricks/

(provided there is a group "games" in /etc/group) or rather to

/home/topic/doc/selfhtml/
/home/topic/clipart/
/home/topic/wallpaper/

where files cannot be associated with a specific project or set of users.

In the User Private Group (UPG) model implemented by this site, actual
projects are normally assigned to user account project groups, and related
data will be placed in a /home/group subdirectory rather than in
/home/project.

The reason for /home/project to exist is if several user account groups work
together on a larger basis or need to publish information for non-group
members also.

While only members of a specific project group have access to
/home/group/<name>, anyone has access to /home/project/<name>.

This allows the administrator to set up subdirectories of /home/project/<name>
which are owned by specific project groups, and the members of those project
groups can publish information there to see for others.

For instance, a directory /home/project/bar/doc/* might contain public
documentation for a project "bar" (being maintained by a closed user-account
group "foo"), while the actual development takes place in directory
/home/group/foo/bar/* which is only accessible to members of group "foo".

user - Directory Information
============================

Subdirectories of this directory represent the home directories of specific
user accounts.

In the hierarchy used by this site, /home/user/<username> serves the same
purpose as /home/<username> does on a typical small system.

By inserting an additional directory level between /home and <username>,
additional useful directories such as /home/project can be added without
violation of the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

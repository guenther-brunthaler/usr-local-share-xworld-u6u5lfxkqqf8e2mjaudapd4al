mnt - Directory Information
===========================

Subdirectories of this directory will be created by administrators,
automount-daemons or specialized mount-tools in order to serve as mount
points.

The mount-points will be visible for everyone, but of course filesystem
permissions can be used to restrict access.

Note that the FHS explictly disencourages the use of /mnt/<mountpoint> for
such purposes: Firstly, /mnt is intended for the private use of user root only
for use as a temporary mount point. Secondly, it shall be possible to use /mnt
as a mountpoint directly rather than just a subdirectory of it. See

http://www.pathname.com/fhs/

for more details.

So /mnt is out of question for serving as a base directory for mount points in
a standard-compliant system, and this is where /home/mnt comes to the rescue.

In cases where the names of mount-points should be kept strictly private, it
might be a better idea to create the mount point in private home- or
group-directories, e. g. $HOME/mnt/<mountpoint>.

On the other hand, it is also possible to create a subdirectory here with
restrictive permissions, and place the delicate mount points there:

mkdir /home/mnt/secret
chgrp losers /home/mnt/secret
chmod o=,g+rsx /home/mnt/secret
mkdir /home/mnt/secret/dieter_bohlen_songs/
mkdir /home/mnt/secret/teletubbies_collection/
mkdir /home/mnt/secret/msdn/
mkdir /home/mnt/secret/sco_friendship_network/

The mount-point directories in /home/mnt/* can be used for hard-disk-based
mounts as well as for network-based mounts (e. g. NFS, SAMBA, SSHFS).

Note, however, that it should not be used for removable media like floppies,
CD-ROMs, DVDs or USB-drives, because the FHS standard defines such mount
points belong into /media/*.

home - Directory Information
============================

This system does not use the /home directory as a direct base directory for
the user account home directories.

Those directories can be found in /home/user/* instead.

The following additional subdirectories exist in ../home:

user - user account home directories
group - user account groups collaboration directories
project - project-related inter-account collaboration directories
topic - contents grouped by area of application
mnt - mount points for nfs/samba or partitions of non-removable harddisks

This organization is compliant with (or does at least not contradict) the
Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). See

for more details.

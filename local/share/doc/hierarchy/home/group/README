group - Directory Information
=============================

Subdirectories of this directory represent the top-level collaboration
directories of specific user account groups.

Typically, only members of the respective groups have access to those
directories and may read or create files there.

The User Private Group (UPG) model implemented by this site exploits the
advantages of working with /home/group/<groupname>.
